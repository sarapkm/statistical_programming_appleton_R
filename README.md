# statistical_programming_appleton_R
Project done in R. Dataset is provided. Statistical analysis and graphing done in order to see trends and relationships between the Total Precipitation (mm) and Surface Water Levels (m) on a daily basis for a year (2012) at Appleton, Ontario, Canada.

This scatterplot depicts the relationship between time (specifically, dates in the year 2012) and daily precipitation values (measured in millimeters). Each point on the plot represents a single day, with the x-coordinate representing the date and the y-coordinate representing the amount of precipitation recorded on that day. The plot showcases the variability in precipitation over the course of the year, with some days experiencing higher rainfall than others. The red points scattered across the plot highlight the distribution of precipitation data over time. The blue line represents the linear regression model fitted to the data.

This scatterplot illustrates the relationship between time (dates in the year 2012) and daily surface water levels (measured in meters). Each point on the plot represents a single day, with the x-coordinate representing the date and the y-coordinate representing the corresponding surface water level recorded on that day. The plot provides a visual representation of how surface water levels fluctuate over time throughout the year. The red points scattered across the plot depict the distribution of surface water level data over the course of the year. The blue line represents the linear regression model fitted to the data.

This scatterplot illustrates the relationship between daily precipitation (measured in millimeters) and surface water levels (measured in meters). Each point on the plot represents a daily observation over the course of 2012 at Appleton, Ontario, Canada. The x-coordinate indicating the amount of precipitation and the y-coordinate indicating the corresponding surface water level. The blue points scattered across the plot indicate the variability in precipitation and its effect on surface water levels. The red line represents the linear regression model fitted to the data, providing insight into the overall trend between precipitation and water levels.
